# Simple-Scheduler
# Written during Spring 2018 Semester

This is a project for my Operating Systems class to create a simple processor scheduler program.

A full description is available in Assignment3Description.pdf

The program reads process information from a text file, and the runs the scheduler. The scheduler is preemptive priority, with a 2 quantum round robin secondary.

A simple GUI was madde for it using Netbean's GUI maker. The GUI shows the Gantt chart and what's currently happening in the scheduler. An image showing the GUI while the program is running is available in SchedulerGUIExample.png

There are multiple classes, but they were kept in one file to make it easy to turn in.

There's also a button with a link to a funny youtube video in the GUI... the professor had similar buttons on his example version so I thought I would respond in kind.
