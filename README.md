# Simple-Scheduler
This is a project for my Operating Systems class to create a simple processor scheduler program.

A full description is available in Assignment3Description.pdf

The program reads process information from a text file, and the runs the scheduler. The scheduler is preemptive priority, with a 2 quantum round robin secondary.

A simple GUI was madde for it using Netbean's GUI maker. The GUI shows the Gantt chart and what's currently happening in the scheduler.
